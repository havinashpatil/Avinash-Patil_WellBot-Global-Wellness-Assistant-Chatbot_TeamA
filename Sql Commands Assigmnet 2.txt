1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations on numeric data.
Operator, Description,                            Example
+,        Addition,                           SELECT Price + 10 FROM Products;
-,        Subtraction,                        SELECT Price - 5 FROM Products;
*,         Multiplication,                    SELECT Price * 1.18 FROM Products; (Adding 18% Tax)
/,        Division,                           SELECT Total / 2 FROM Orders;
%,        Modulo (Remainder),                 SELECT ID % 2 FROM Users; (Find even/odd IDs)

2. Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values. These return a boolean (True/False).

Operator,           Description,                      Example
=,                 Equal to,                          SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = 'Avinash';
!= or <>,          Not equal to,                      SELECT * FROM Users WHERE status <> 'Active';
>,                 Greater than,                      SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Stock > 100;
<,                 Less than,                         SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price < 500;
>=,                Greater than or equal to,          SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Marks >= 35;
<=,                Less than or equal to,             SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Sem <= 5;

3. Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions or negate them.

Operator,                  Description,                          Example
AND,                       True if all conditions are true,      WHERE Age > 18 AND City = 'Bellary'
OR,                        True if any one condition is true,    WHERE Sem = 5 OR Sem = 6
NOT,                       Reverses the condition,               WHERE NOT City = 'Pune'
BETWEEN,                   Within a range (inclusive),           WHERE Price BETWEEN 100 AND 500
IN,                        Matches any value in a list,         "WHERE Language IN ('Python', 'Java', 'C++')"
LIKE,                      Search for a pattern,                 WHERE Name LIKE 'A%' (Starts with A)
IS NULL,                   Checks for empty values,               WHERE email IS NULL
EXISTS,                    Checks if a subquery returns data,     WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders WHERE user_id = u.id)

4. Set Operators
Used to combine the results of two different SELECT statements.

UNION: Combines distinct rows from both queries.

UNION ALL: Combines all rows (including duplicates).

INTERSECT: Returns only common rows between both queries.

EXCEPT (or MINUS): Returns rows from the first query that are not in the second.

Ex: SELECT * FROM chats 
WHERE mood = 'Sad' AND timestamp > '2026-02-11';
